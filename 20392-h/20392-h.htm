<p>According to the U.S.A. Bureau of

<p>In connection with the Ministry of

<p>It appears that the man who was

<p>In describing a storm

<h2>BELLES OF THE BALL.</h2>

<p>A football eleven composed of work-girls
from a Lancashire factory recently
journeyed to Paris to play a team of
French female footballers. With women
forcing an entry into the ranks of
minor professions, such as the Law and
Politics, it is doubtful if even the sacred
precincts of professional football can
now be considered safe, and Mr. Punch
wonders if he may soon find himself
reading in the Sporting Columns of the
Press paragraphs something in the
nature of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Kitty Golightly, who has the reputation
of being one of the fastest young
women seen in London this season, has
now definitely thrown in her lot with
the Tottenham Hotstuff. Her forward
work is likely to cause something in
the nature of a sensation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The dropping of Hilda Smith from
the League team of Newcastle United
has been much criticised by football
enthusiasts throughout the country.
We are, however, in a position to state
that there has been trouble between
Hilda Smith and the Newcastle Directors
for some time past. It appears that
Newcastle's brilliant full-back objected
to wearing the Newcastle jersey, on the
plea that its sombre colour-scheme did
not suit her complexion. She pointed
out that Fanny Robinson, the Newcastle
goal-keeper, wore an all-red jersey
and that, as the shade chosen was
most becoming to anyone with dark
hair, she (Hilda Smith) claimed the right
to wear red also. The Newcastle
Directors replied that under the laws
of the Football Association the goal-keeper
is required to wear distinctive
colours from the rest of the team.
That being so, Hilda Smith would only
consent to turn out in future on condition
that she should play in goal, and
as the club management would not
agree to displacing Fanny Robinson
the only thing to be done was to leave
Hilda Smith out of the side entirely.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What would have been a very serious
misfortune to the team chosen to
represent England in the forthcoming
International against Wales has only
just been averted. But for the common-sense
and good feeling of all concerned,
Dolly Brown, the English captain,
might have found herself assisting the
Welsh side instead of her own country's
eleven. Not long ago this brilliant back
became engaged to a Welsh gentleman
from Llanfairfechan and the wedding
had been fixed for Thursday next.
Under the present state of the British
Constitution a married woman takes on
the nationality of her husband, and had
the marriage been solemnized before
the International Match on Saturday
Dolly Brown would have been ineligible
for England and available for Wales.
On this being pointed out to her she
at once consented to postpone her marriage,
like the patriotic sportswoman
she is, and in the meantime legislation
is to be rushed through both Houses of
Parliament to alter the absurd state of
the law and retain for England the
services of one of the finest backs that
ever fouled a forward.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. Ted Hustler, the popular chairman
of the Villa North End Club, has
been away from home for some days,
rumour being strong in his native city
that he has gone to Scotland after Jennie
Macgregor. On our representative calling
at Mr. Hustler's house this morning
to inquire if it really were true that
Mr. Hustler has for a long time had his
eye on Jennie Macgregor, Mrs. Hustler,
the charming wife of the chairman,
was understood to reply that she would
like to catch him at it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The regrettable incident at Stamford
Bridge on Saturday last, when Gertie
Swift was sent off the field by the
referee, is to our mind yet another
example of the misguided policy of the
League management. Gertie Swift was
strongly reprimanded by Mr. G. H.
Whistler, the official in charge of the
match, for an alleged offence. Gertie
Swift retorted. Mr. Whistler warned
her. Gertie again retorted. Mr. Whistler
then ordered Gertie to retire from the
game. Whilst we quite agree that a
referee must exercise a strong control
it is perfectly obvious that no self-respecting
woman player is going to
allow any mere man to have the last
word; and the sooner the Football Association
realise this and dispense with
the services of all male referees the
better for the good of the game.</p>

<p>Our arrangements for a full report of
the English Cup Final are now completed.
Our fashion experts are to
journey to London with both teams, and
a detailed description of the hats and
travelling costumes worn by the players
will appear in an extra special edition
of this paper. We understand that the
two rival elevens are to turn out in silk
jumpers knitted in correct club colours
by the players' own fair hands during
the more restful periods of their strenuous
training.</p>

<p>Self-praise, it used to be held, is
no recommendation; but that was
before the War. The War has
altered so many things that it may
have altered this too, and self-praise be the best
recommendation of all. Mr. Punch hopes so,
because he wants to indulge for the moment in
extolling one of his own products; he wishes,
in short, to urge upon all his readers the merits
of "Mr. Punch's History of the Great War."
Everything is here, in very noteworthy synthesis;
the tragedy and the comedy inextricably
mingled, as they must ever be, but as by more
formal historians they are not.</p>

<p>Such is Mr. Punch's opinion on Mr. Punch's
own book, which is no formal history of the
War in the strict or scientific sense of the phrase;
no detailed record of naval and military operations.
Rather it is a mirror of varying moods,
reflecting in the main how England remained
steadfastly true to her best traditions; a reflex
of British character during the days of doubt
and the hours of hope that marked the strenuous
and wearying days of the War.</p>

<p>All ages and classes come into the picture&mdash;combatants
and non-combatants, young and old,
men and women. And Mr. Punch's pencil plays
a part at least equal to that of his pen, the record
of each month being generously supplied with
cartoons and illustrations by famous <i>Punch</i>
artists. Into these pages has been compressed
just what we need to remember about the
War, and we are reminded of
things which we had already forgotten.
Here is the tragedy and
the pathos of the Great War&mdash;even
the comedy of those great
years of undying memory.</p>

<p>No more popular history of
the War has been written; it has
been eulogised everywhere, for it
is a book that every citizen of the
Empire should read and be proud
to possess. As a Christmas gift
it is ideal, and will be gladly welcomed
not only by those at home,
but also by those in Canada, Australia,
India, South Africa, and

<h2><i>An Immortal Story</i></h2>

<p>"Mr. Punch's History of the
Great War" is a History
we can all read, and all
<i>should</i> read, for here is the record of
the heroes who added to the glories
of our blood and State&mdash;a roll that
is endless&mdash;wonderful gunners and
sappers, and airmen and despatch
riders, devoted surgeons and heroic
nurses, stretcher-bearers and ambulance
drivers. "But Mr. Punch's
special heroes are the Second-Lieutenants
and the Tommy who went
on winning the War all the time,
and never said that he was winning
it until it was won."</p>

<p>To read this book will help us
to realise the great debt, unpaid and
unpayable, to our immortal dead and
to the valiant survivors, to whom we owe freedom and security.</p>

<p>It is "a corrective record," says <i>The Times</i>, "not only of what happened
'over there,' but of what people were saying and feeling at home"; while
<i>The Morning Post</i> remarked: "Here Mr. Punch is the nation, deftly
wielding the weapon of ridicule that has helped to kill so many enemy
tyrants."</p>

<h2>UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p class="center">III.&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir Eric Geddes</span>.</p>

<p>Which is boyhood's commonest ambition,
to run away to sea or to be something
on a railway line? And how
few, when they are grown up, find that
they have realised either of these desires!
The present Minister of Transport
has freely confessed to his intimates
that more than once, when he
was floating paper-boats in his bath or
climbing a tree in the garden to look
out for icebergs from the crow's-nest,
he felt in his child's heart that water
was the ultimate quest, the adventure,
the gleam. And yet for many a long
year railways entranced and enslaved
him. Often he would sit for hours, forgetful
of the griddle cakes rapidly being
burnt to a cinder, and gaze at the puffs
of steam coming from the spout of the
kettle or the quick vibrations of its lid,
planning in his mind some greater and
better engine that should be known
perhaps as The Snorting Eric, and be
enshrined in glass on Darlington platform.</p>

<p>Once, when he had bought a small
model stationary engine and the methylated
spirit lamp had by some accident
set fire to the carpet, he was found after
the conflagration had subsided standing
serenely amongst the wreckage.
When challenged as to its cause, "I
cannot tell a lie," he replied calmly;
"I did it with my little gadget." A
few months later he and the present
Ambassador of Great Britain at Washington
had constructed a double line
of miniature tracks, which connected
all the rooms on the ground floor of
the house and considerably interfered
with the parlourmaid's duties. It was
known to the family as the Great
Auckland Railway. Another favourite
hobby of the young engineer was to
lie on his back and watch the spider
spin her web, comparing the results
with a railway map of Great Britain.
It was seldom that he went to bed
without having learnt at least a page
of <i>Bradshaw</i> by heart.</p>

<p>Going from strength to strength this
apparently dreamy lad had climbed the
giddy rungs of fame until, at the outbreak
of war, he stood with the ball at
his feet and the title of Deputy General
Manager of the N.E.R. It was he who
had invented the system whereby the
handle of the heating apparatus in railway
carriages could be turned either to
<span class="sc">off</span> or <span class="sc">on</span> without any consequent infiltration
of steam, thereby saving
passengers from the peril of death by
suffocation. It was he who, thumping
the table with an iron fist, had insisted
vehemently that caged parrots travelling
in the rack should, if capable
of speech, be compelled to pay the full
fare. It was he who effected one of
the greatest economies that the line had
ever known by using rock-cakes which
had served their term of years in the
refreshment-room as a substitute for
the keys which hold the metals of the
permanent way in their chairs.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1914 he was about
to adopt a patent device for connecting
the official notices in compartments
with gramophones concealed under the
seats in such a way that when humourists
had by dint of much labour made
the customary emendations, such as "<span class="sc">It
is dangerous to leap out of the
windows</span>," "<span class="sc">To stop the &nbsp;&nbsp;rain pull
down the chain</span>" and "<span class="sc">To &nbsp;&nbsp;eat five
persons only</span>," a loud and merry peal
of laughter should suddenly hail the
completed masterpiece.</p>

<p>Armageddon supervened, and the rest
of Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes'</span> career is history.
When a new and sure hand was needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span>
at the Admiralty, Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
was not long in making the only suitable
choice. Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span>' bluff
hearty manner, positively smacking,
despite his inland training, of all that
a viking ought to smack of, had long
marked him out as the ideal ruler of
the King's Navy, and his name was
soon known and feared wherever the
seagull dips its wing. Underneath the
breezy exterior lay an iron will, like a
precipitate in a tonic for neurasthenia,
and scarcely had he boarded the famous
building in Whitehall and mounted his
quarter-deck (Naval terms are always
used at the Admiralty, the windows
being called "port-holes" and the staircases
the "companion") than victory
began to crown the arms of the Senior
Service.</p>

<p>But peace no less than war finds an
outlet for the energies of the old sea-dog,
and the veriest hint of a railway
strike finds him ready with flotillas of
motor lorries in commission and himself
in his flag char-à-banc, aptly named
the Queen of Eryx, at their head.
Lever, marlin-spike or steering wheel,
it is all one to the brain which can co-ordinate
squadrons as easily as rolling-stock,
to the man who is now sometimes
known as the Stormy Petrol of
the Cabinet. Yet even so the sailor is
strongest in him still. It is not
generally known that Sir <span class="sc">Eric</span> has
already cocked his weather eye at our
inland waterways as an auxiliary line
of defence in case of need. Experience
has taught him that it is even now
quicker to travel, let us say, from
Boston (Lincs.) to Wolverhampton, by
river and canal than by rail, and the
future may yet see Thames, Trent and
Severn churned to foam by motor
barges of incredible rapidity, distributing
the nation's food supplies.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that the
Ministry of Transport has, so to say,
up its sleeve, and is alone a sufficient
answer to those who suggest that this
Ministry has outlived its hour. There
is a grim Norse spirit amongst its
officials, inspired perhaps by their chieftain's
name, and already the plans for
a first-class Pullman galley are under
way. As <span class="sc">Longfellow</span> sings:&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE SNIPER.</h2>

<p>Brackley is a good fellow, but I loathe him.</p>

<p>How would you like it if you were tied to work and
every now and then a man came up to you in your club
and said, "Old man, do come away with me to the Pyrenees
and shoot jummel," or "Can't you spare a month, old
fellow, to come stalking ibex in Montenegro with me?"
or "Look here, you're just the chap I want to run over
to Alaska with me for a pot at the grizzlies"?</p>

<p>Just a fortnight ago Brackley came and told me of a
delightful rough shooting he had rented in an obscure
corner of Ireland. According to him it was a congested
snipe area. You could not see the pools for wild-duck. The
honking of wild-geese kept one awake at night. The
drawback to the estate was that you were always tripping
over hares.</p>

<p>"You won't be safe there," I said to Brackley.</p>

<p>"I'm safe anywhere," said Brackley. "Work it on
system. In Arabia send the mullah a bottle of brandy.
On the Continent stand the local mayor a bottle of wine.
In Ireland ask the priest up to drink whiskey with you in
the evening. So long as the authorities have their thirst
relieved there's never trouble. Now just come for a fortnight.
There'll be crowds of snipe. I'm told there are
woodcock too."</p>

<p>I was adamant.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Brackley, "I'll send you a card to say
how I get on."</p>

<p>When his postcard arrived it ran:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" class="w60" summary="Postcard from Ballinagrub">
<tr><td class="sle">"To-day&mdash;</td><td class="sri">"<i>Ballinagrub</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="ind2">Ten brace snipe.</p></td><td><p class="ind2">Four landrail.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="ind2">One brace partridge.</p></td><td><p class="ind2">Three wild-duck.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="ind2">Nine hares.</p></td><td><p class="ind2">One woodcock.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td class="sle">"What ho!"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Isn't that an aggravating card to get when you are deep
in the most elusive and trying chase of all&mdash;the money
hunt?</p>

<p>I wrote Brackley a scornful postcard:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on with your baleful schemes. Wallow in slaughter.
Roll in blood. Devastate the district. As an honest
hard-working Englishman I regard you with utter contempt."</p>

<p>Three days later Brackley slapped me on the back in our
club.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" I said. "Don't tell me
the snipe have gone on strike."</p>

<p>"All your fault," he grumbled. "About half-an-hour
after I got your infernal postcard six outsize Republican
soldiers called on me and gave me just ten minutes to get
a car and drive to the station. I told them what a silly
fool you were and that it was one of your wretched jokes;
but you can't expect an Irishman to see a joke. I tried to
explain it; I said that you referred to my exploits as a
sniper; and they replied that sniping was their department
and nobody else's.</p>

<p>"So I decided to come home and arrange for some shooting
in a place where there's a bit of peace. I'm thinking of
going after the ongdu antelopes in Somaliland. You can't
spare three months, can you?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you face it out?" I said, knowing that
Brackley had spent four years and two months of his life
shooting Huns.</p>

<p>"Not worth while. I could have had a guard, of course.
But you can't expect decent snipe-shooting when there's a
lot of promiscuous firing going on in the district. The snipe
is a peculiarly nervous bird, you know."</p>

<h2>IF THEY WERE AT SCHOOL.</h2>

<p>(<i>That is, if the House of Commons
were like our School Debating Society&mdash;as
indeed it is&mdash;and if its proceedings
were reported with the incisive brevity
of our School Magazine&mdash;and why not?</i>)</p>

<p>On Wednesday the Society held its
2,187th meeting. There was some
regrettable rowdiness during Private
Business, and <span class="sc">A. Moseley</span> (Collegers)
had to be ejected for asking too many
questions. Members must not bring
bags of gooseberries into the debates.</p>

<p>In Public Business the motion was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>That in the opinion of this House
Science is better than Sport</i>."</p>

<p><span class="sc">D. Lloyd George</span>, Proposer (School
House), said that Science had won the
War, and quoted Wireless Telegraphy
and Daylight Saving to prove this. The
most successful Generals had had a
scientific training. His uncle had met
a General who knew algebra and used
it at the Battle of the Marne. Only
two first-class cricketers had ever been
in the Cabinet. Three scientists had.
The earth went round the sun. The
moon went round the earth. Rivers
flowed into the ocean.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  An improving speaker, who is inclined
  to be carried away by his enthusiasm.
  Too many metaphors.
</p></blockquote>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span></div>

<p><span class="sc">H. Asquith</span>, Opposer (Collegers),
said that the speech of the hon.
Proposer was a tissue of fabrications,
as ineffective as they were insincere.
Never in the whole course of his career
had he encountered a subterfuge so
transparent, a calumny so shameless
as the attempt of the Hon. Prop., he
might say the calculated and cynical
attempt of the Hon. Prop., to seduce
from their faith the tenacious acolytes
of Sport by the now threadbare recital
of the dubious and, on his own showing,
the anæmic enticements of Science.
The War had proved that Science was
no good.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  This speaker is steadily improving,
  but he has a tendency to a "fatal
  fluency," and he must beware of high-sounding
  phrases. Also too many
  passages in his speech sounded like
  quotations.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">A. Bonar Law</span>, Seconder (Commoners),
said that the War had proved
that Sport was no good. Gas had been
invented by Science. He pointed out
the importance of astronomy in navigation.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  A rapidly improving speaker. But
  he must not mumble.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">E. G. <a class="correction" title="most likely misprint for 'PRETYMAN' - see ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT below">Prettyman</a></span> (Hodgeites) said
that farming was both a science and a
sport. The canal system of Great
Britain had been neglected.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  Some neat little epigrams.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie Scott</span> (Collegers) said that
his father was a lawyer. Science had
been used in the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  This speaker was not at his best.
  Perhaps it was the gooseberries.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Leslie Wilson</span> (Hittites) said that
his Christian name was the same as
the previous speaker's&mdash;(Laughter)&mdash;but
his views were very different.
(Loud laughter.) He would like to
ask the House which had done most
in the War&mdash;Tanks or Banks.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  The speech of the evening. Witty
  and well-argued. But he must not
  fidget with his waistcoat-buttons.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">W. S. Churchill</span> (Hivites) said that
this was a revolutionary motion. Sport
and Science must stand together. True
sport was scientific and true scientists
were sportsmen. (Applause.) Together
they would stand as an imperishable
bulwark against the relentless tide of
Socialism. Divided they would fall.</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p><span class="sc">H. A. L. Fisher</span> (Collegers) was in
favour of Proportional Education.</p>

  He must not lecture.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">E. Geddes</span> (Perizzites) said he did
not mind what game he played. Rugger,
Soccer, Hockey, Cricket, Lacrosse,
Rounders&mdash;he was equally at home
with all of them.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  An improving speaker. He must
  not speak at the roof; there is no one
  there.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">F. Banbury</span> (Sittites) must not go on

<p><span class="sc">A. Mond</span> (Moabites) must not fidget
with his feet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">H. D. King</span> (Hivites) said that sailing
was scientific.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  He has not been heard before.

<p><span class="sc">R. Kenworthy</span> (Day-boy) must not
be heard again.</p>

<h3>A DIFFICULT CASE.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;This is one of
those social problems which end by
asking what A should do, only in this
case I want to know what you would
do.</p>

<p>It happened on the first day of my
leave, just after I had, as is my custom
on this day, had my hair cut and otherwise
made beautiful at a place in Bond
Street. (I am afraid this sounds as if
I was a rich man, but really I am a
Naval Officer.)</p>

<p>I was wearing&mdash;well, that would not
interest you, but it really was rather a
pleasant suit, with a hat which even
<i>The Daily Mail</i> could not improve
upon. Briefly, I was strolling along
in a perfectly contented frame of mind
when a horse, drawing a van, chose to
fall down right alongside me.</p>

<p>In a moment of rashness and chivalry&mdash;have
I said that the horse was being
driven by a girl?&mdash;I promptly sat on
the brute's head, an act which I had
always been told is the correct thing to
do, though, I should imagine, discouraging
for the horse.</p>

<p>In my haste I sat down with my
back to the van, so was unable to gauge
the progress of the refitting work which
was going on.</p>

<p>In an effort to convey to the crowd,
which had, of course, collected, that I
was in no way embarrassed, nay more,
that I was well accustomed to sitting
on horses' heads in the middle of Bond
Street, I lit a cigarette and tried to
look <i>blasé</i>, no easy thing to do in the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Small boys made tactless remarks
about my personal appearance and
eccentric habits, but I ignored them,
feverishly thinking that this adventure
would necessitate an early visit to my
club. I had just decided what brand
of cocktail would best meet the case
when I felt a tap on my shoulder and
looked up at a vast blue expanse which
I realised later was a policeman.</p>

<p>"If you've quite finished with that
there 'orse you're sitting on, young
man," he said, "the leddy wants to
take it 'ome."</p>

<p>The crowd chuckled and I rose
hurriedly. Unfortunately, so did the
horse, urged on, possibly by the cries
and kicks of several willing helpers, or
possibly by the sight of his mistress,
who had come up, I hoped, to thank me.</p>

<p>Not only did the horse rise, but he
rose at full speed and without giving
me time to get my foot off the rein on
which I was unwittingly standing.</p>

<p>My leg shot into the air and I lost
all sense of direction for a few seconds.
Then a slight shock, and I found myself
clasping the "leddy" firmly round
the neck.</p>

<p>At this juncture my aunt appeared.</p>

<p>My aunt, I should explain, is nothing
if not dignified. She is built on the
lines of a monitor, bluff in the bow,
broad in the beam, slow and majestic
of movement. Her lips were moving
feebly when I saw her, but she uttered
no sound, uncertain, I suppose, whether
to intervene or to pretend that I was
in no way connected with her.</p>

<p>Paralysed by her arrival, I saw her
slowly take in the scene. Her eye
wandered from the policeman to me,
from me to the unfortunate girl to
whom I still clung. I could see her
jumping&mdash;no, moving ponderously&mdash;towards
the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. Punch, what would you have
done?</p>

<p class="i5">Yours faithfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An N.O.</p>

<p>[Your first thought should have been
for the girl, whom you had clearly compromised
in your aunt's eyes. You should
at once have introduced her to that
lady as your long-lost <i>fiancée</i>. Later
in the afternoon you could have called
on your relative and told her that you
had mislaid the girl again&mdash;this time
irretrievably.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed</span>.]</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p><i>Monday, November 15th.</i>&mdash;To induce
the House of Lords to accept a measure
for the compulsory acquisition of land
is analogous to the process of getting
butter out of a dog's
mouth; and it is not
surprising that Lord
<span class="sc">Peel</span> essayed the task
of getting a second
reading for an Acquisition
of Lands Bill in
rather gingerly fashion.
When one remembered
a racy correspondence
in the
newspapers over certain
Midlothian farms
one could hardly have
been surprised if the
Laird of <span class="sc">Dalmeny</span>
had reappeared in the
arena, flourishing his
claymore. But, alas!
he still remains in retirement,
and it was
left to Lord <span class="sc">Sumner</span>
to administer some
sound legal thwacks
and, in his own words,
to "dispel the mirage
which the noble Viscount
raised over the
sand of a very arid
Bill." He did not oppose
the Second Reading,
but hinted that if
ever it emerged from Committee its
own draftsman would not know <a class="correction" title="missing period in original">it.</a></p>

<p>The <span class="sc">President of the Board of
Trade</span> must regard Monday with rather
mixed feelings. That is the day on which
Questions addressed to his Department
have first place on the Order-paper;
and accordingly he has a lively quarter-of-an-hour
in coping with the contradictory
conundrums of Cobdenites and
Chamberlainites. On the whole he treads
the fiscal tight-rope with an imperturbability
worthy of <span class="sc">Blondin</span>. A Tariff Reformer,
indignant at the increased imports
of foreign glass-ware, provoked
the query, "Does my hon. friend regard
bottles as a key-industry?" And a Wee
Free Trader who sarcastically inquired
if foreign countries complained of our
dumping cement on them at prices
much above the cost in this country
was promptly told that "that is the
very reverse of dumping."</p>

<h4>THE OVERLOADED OMNIBUS.</h4>

<p><i>Conductor <span class="sc">Addison</span> (to Driver <span class="sc">Law</span>).</i> <span class="sc">"What, you can't get 'ome by Christmas

</div>
</div>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Donald Maclean</span> was rewarded
to-night for all his uphill work as
leader of the Wee Frees before&mdash;and
since&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> reappearance. On
the Financial Resolution of the Ministry
of Health Bill his eloquent plea for the
harassed ratepayers received an almost
suspiciously prompt response from Mr.
<span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>, who admitted that it was
inconvenient to drive an "omnibus"
measure of this kind through an Autumn
Session, and intimated that thirteen of
its clauses would be jettisoned. An
appeal from Lady <span class="sc">Astor</span>, that the
Government should not "economise in
health," fell upon deaf ears. Dr. <span class="sc">Addison</span>
not only enumerated the thirteen
doomed clauses, but threw in a fourteenth
for luck.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, November 16th.</i>&mdash;I don't suppose
Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span> and the other noble
Lords who enlarged upon the theme
"<i>Persicos odi</i>" expected to embarrass
the <span class="sc">Foreign Secretary</span> by their cross-questioning.
Persia is to Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span>
what "de brier-patch"
was to <i>Brer Rabbit</i>.
He has been cultivating
it all his life, and
knows every twist and
turn of its complicated
history, ancient and
modern. The gist of
his illuminating lecture
to the Peers was
that our one aim had
been to maintain Persian
independence
with due regard to
British interests, and
that it now rested
with the Persians
themselves to decide
their own destiny.</p>

</div>

<p>Hopes of a relaxation
of the passport
restrictions were a
little dashed by Mr.
<span class="sc">Harmsworth's</span> announcement
that the
fees received for British
visas amounted
to some fifty per cent.
more than the cost
of the staff employed.
The Government will
naturally be loth to
scrap a Department which actually
earns its keep.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">War Minister</span> was again badgered
about the hundred Rolls-Royces
that he had ordered for Mesopotamia.
Now that we were contemplating withdrawal
was it necessary to have them?
To this Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span> replied that the
new Arab State would still require our
assistance. A mental picture of the
sheikhs taking joy-rides in automobiles
<i>de luxe</i> presented itself to Mr. <span class="sc">Hogge</span>,
who gave notice that he should "reduce"
the Army Estimates by the
price of the chassis. A little later Mr.
<span class="sc">Churchill</span> came down heavily on an
innocent Coalitionist who had proffered
suggestions as to the better safeguarding
of the troops in Ireland. "Odd as
it may seem," he told him, "this
aspect of the question has engaged the
attention of the military authorities."</p>

<p>In the course of debate on the Agricultural
Bill, Mr. <span class="sc">Acland</span> hinted that
Sir <span class="sc">F. Banbury</span>, one of its severest
critics, was out of touch with rural
affairs. Whereupon Mr. <span class="sc">Pretyman</span>
came to the rescue with the surprising
revelation that the junior Member for
the City of London, in addition to his
vocations as banker, stockbroker and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span>
railway director, had on one occasion
carried out the functions of "shepherd
to a lambing flock." The right hon.
Baronet, who is known to his intimates
as "Peckham," will have Mr. <span class="sc">Pretyman</span>
to thank if his <i>sobriquet</i> in future
is "Little Bo-Peep."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, November 17th.</i>&mdash;The
Lords, having welcomed the Bishop of
<span class="sc">Durham</span>&mdash;a notable addition to the oratorical
strength of the Episcopal Bench&mdash;proceeded
to show that even the lay
peers had not much to learn in the
matter of polite invective. Lord <span class="sc">Gainford</span>
invited them to declare that the
Government should forthwith reduce
its swollen Departmental staffs and incidentally
relieve our open spaces from
the eyesores that now
disfigure them. Perhaps
he laid overmuch
stress upon the latter
part of his motion, for
the Ministerial spokesman
rode off on this
line&mdash;Lord <span class="sc">Crawford</span>
confessing that his artistic
sensibility was
outraged by these "horrible
hutments"&mdash;and
said very little about
cutting down the staffs.
This way of treating the
matter dissatisfied the
malcontents, who voted
down the Ministry.</p>

<p><span class="sc">With Mr. Punch's best wishes to Captain Wedgwood Benn.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Front Opposition
Bench in the Commons
was almost deserted at
Question-time. Presently
the appearance
of Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span> in unusually
festive attire furnished
an explanation.
After forty years of
bachelorship and four
of fighting, <span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</span> is Benedict
indeed; and his colleagues were
attending his wedding-festivities.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Secretary to the Admiralty</span>
has not yet attained to the omniscience
in Naval affairs that his predecessor
acquired in the course of twelve years'
continuous occupancy of the post. But
Sir <span class="sc">James Craig</span> can handle an awkward
questioner no less deftly than
"Dr. <span class="sc">Mac.</span>" Witness his excuse for
not replying to a "Supplementary":&mdash;"The
hon. and gallant gentleman must
understand that I attach so much importance
to his questions that I wish
to be most punctilious in my answers."
Who could persist after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> stated that the
treaties by which Great Britain and
France were responsible for constitutional
government in Greece came to
an end in August last. Consequently
the two Powers have "a completely
free hand" in regard to the Greek
Monarchy. But he begged to be excused
from saying in what manner that
"free hand" would bee used if <span class="sc">Tino</span>
should think of returning.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, November 18th.</i>&mdash;In the
Lords the Acquisition of Land Bill had
most of its teeth drawn. Lord <span class="sc">Sumner</span>
was the most adroit of the many
operators employed, and he used no
gas.</p>

<p>The usual dreary duel of Nationalist
insinuation and Ministerial denial in regard
to Irish happenings was lightened
by one or two interludes. Mr. <span class="sc">Jack
Jones</span> loudly suggested that the Government
should send for General <span class="sc">Ludendorff</span>
to show them how to carry
out reprisals. "He is no friend of
<i>mine</i>," retorted the <span class="sc">Chief Secretary</span>,
with subtle emphasis. Later he read a
long letter from the C.-in-C. of the Irish
Republican Army to his Chief of Staff
discussing the possibility of enlisting
the germs of typhoid and glanders in
their noble fight for freedom. The
House listened with rapt attention until
Sir <span class="sc">Hamar</span> came to the pious conclusion,
"God bless you all." Amid the
laughter that followed this anti-climax
Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span> was heard to ask, "Was
not the whole thing concocted in Dublin
Castle?" Well, if so, Dublin Castle
must have developed a sense of humour
quite foreign to its traditions. Perhaps
that is the reason why the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>,
earlier in the Sitting, expressed
the opinion that "things in Ireland are
getting much better."</p>

<p class="note">[Note.&mdash;The author is surprised, not to say
pained, at the conspiracy of silence on the
part of the daily Press, as a result of which
he is left to write this matter up himself.
However ...]</p>

<p>A sombre court-house of Quarter
Sessions, the light with difficulty penetrating
the dusty panes of the windows.
On the so-called Bench
sits the Bench so-called;
in point of fact there
are half-a-dozen ripe
aldermen sitting on
chairs, in the midst of
which is an arm-chair,
and in it Mr. Augustus
Jones, the Recorder of
Bilbury.</p>

<p>Born in 1873 of rich
but respectable parents;
called, with no uncertain
voice, to the Bar in
1894; of a weighty corpulence
and stormy visage,
Mr. Jones now settles
himself in his arm-chair
to hear and determine
all this business
about Absalom Adkins
and the Boots. How
admirably impressive is
Mr. Jones's typically
English absence of hysteria,
his calm, his restfulness.
Indeed, give
Mr. Jones five minutes
to himself and it is even
betting he would be fast asleep.</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Court with awful
dignity suggests getting a move on.
Mr. <a class="correction" title="original had 'Blathwayte'">Blaythwayte</a> who, as well as Clerk
of the Court is also Town Clerk of Bilbury,
was born in 1850 and, having
survived the intervening years, now
demands the production of the prisoner
from below. Looking at this dignitary
one gets the poetic impression of a mass
of white hair, white moustache, white
whiskers, white beard and white wig,
with little bits of bright red face appearing
in between. From a crevice
in one of these patches come the ominous
words, of which we catch but a
sample or two: "... Prisoner at the
bar ... for that you did ... steal,
take and carry away ... pairs of
boots ... of our Lord the King, his
crown and dignity."</p>

<p>At this moment there arrives in court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span>
a sinister figure wearing the wig and
gown so much affected by the English
Bar. Plainly a man of character and of
moment; obviously selected with great
care for this highly difficult and delicate
matter. His features are sharp, clean-cut.
One feels that they have been
sharpened and cut clean this very morning.
In his hand he holds the fateful
brief, pregnant with damnatory facts.
He makes his way into the pen reserved
"For Counsel only." The usher locks
him in for safety's sake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Persons in the Drama (so far).</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Augustus Jones.</i> Recorder. Born in <a class="correction" title="missing period in original">1873.</a></p>

<p><i>Mr. Joseph K. Blaythwayte.</i> Clerk of the
Court. Born in 1850.</p>

<p><i>Absalom Adkins</i>, of uncertain age, supposed
boot-fancier.</p>

<p><i>Our Lord the King</i>, whose peace, crown and
dignity are reported to have been rudely disturbed
by the alleged activities of Absalom
Adkins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is this strong silent man, this
robed counsellor trusted with the case
of the Crown? Who is it? It is I!
Born in the year&mdash;but if I'm to tell
my life story it's a thousand pounds I
want. Make it guineas and I will include
portraits of self and relations,
with place of birth, inset.</p>

<p>The scenario (or do we mean the
scene?) is now complete. Leading
characters, minor characters, chorus,
supernumeraries and I myself are all on
the stage. Absalom Adkins, clad in a
loose-fitting corduroy lounge suit and his
neck encased in a whitish kerchief, rises
from his seat. Mr. Jones, the Recorder,
does much as he was doing before&mdash;nothing
in particular. Counsel for the
prosecution re-reads his brief, underlines
the significant points, forgets that
his pencil is a blue one and licks it. On
a side-table, impervious to their surroundings
and apparently unconcerned
with their significance, sit the crucial
boots.</p>

<p>"How say you, Absalom Adkins"&mdash;such
the concluding words of the
Clerk, the finish of the prologue which
rings up the curtain on this human
drama&mdash;"how say you? Are you
guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Guilty," says Absalom, and that
ends it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Later a large and enthusiastic crowd
outside (had there been one) might have
seen a man with clean and sharp-cut
features carrying a bag in one hand
and an umbrella in the other, stepping
lightly on to a Bilbury corporation tram,
station bound. This is the counsel for
the prosecution (still me), his grave
responsibilities honourably discharged,
hurrying back to the vortex of metropolitan
life.</p>

<h2>THE LETTERS I NEVER POST.</h2>

<p><i>I met a philosopher the other day&mdash;he
is not a philosopher by profession,
but an architect&mdash;who told me that,
when annoyed by the anomalies and
petty red-tape restrictions of life or irritated
by incompetence and incivility, or
even when he feels that he can amend
somebody else's error or propose an improvement,
it is his habit to write a
letter expressing his indignation or embodying
his suggestions.</i></p>

<p><i>After remarking that he must be kept
very busy I asked him what kind of
replies he got.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Oh, I don't get any replies," he said,
"because, you see, I don't send the letters;
I only write them and then I tear
them up.</i>"</p>

<p><i>This is how I knew that he was a
philosopher.</i></p>

<p><i>I propose to take to philosophy myself.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">To a Taxi-Driver.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;(You must understand,
as must all the people that I address
in these epistles, that by "dear" I do
not necessarily imply any affection. I
employ the word because I am too old
to care about breaking down harmless
conventions; but I might claim in the
present connection that it has more
than one meaning. That indeed you
will see, if you read on, is the main
point of this letter.)&mdash;Dear Sir, then,
you may remember me. I am the fare
who hailed you on your rank at the
corner of Fulham Road and Drayton
Gardens last Tuesday evening at a
quarter to six, and told you to drive to
the Marble Arch. You put down the
flag and then jumped off the box to
wind up the starter. It failed, and after
several attempts you had to examine
the machinery. I suppose that six
minutes were occupied in this way,
whether because you are a bad mechanic
or a careless fellow or because
the engine is defective, I cannot say;
all I know is that I was in a hurry and
that the flag was down, but we were not
moving. If you had not put the flag
down I should have got out and taken
another cab; but I felt that that would
be unfair to you. When, however, at
the end of the journey I paid you
without adding any tip, and you received
the money with an offensive
grunt, I wished that I had been less
considerate.</p>

<p>It is because nothing that I could
have said then, in your horrid hostile
mood, would have convinced you that
there is any injustice to a fare at all in
putting down your flag before you are
properly started, that I am writing this
letter. My hope is that quiet perusal
may demonstrate that the fare has, at
any rate, a grain of logic on his side if
he looks upon himself as defrauded.
We don't, you know, take your cabs
for the joy of sitting in them, or for the
pleasure of watching you struggling
with a crank, but to be conveyed quickly
from place to place. It is wrong to ask
us to pay for the time spent by you in
persuading your engine to behave, and
it is indecent to become abusive when
we act on that assumption. If I had not
been so busy I should have refused to
pay at all and forced you to summon
me; but who has time for such costly
formalities? And I might have had
to lose my temper, which I have not
done (much) since I read an article by
a doctor saying that every such loss
means an abbreviation of life. Life in
a world made fit for heroes may not be
any great catch, but it is better, at any
rate, than passing to a region where
one is apparently liable to be in constant
communication with mediums.</p>

<p>One other thing. I have just returned
from Paris, where, amid much
that is unsatisfactory and besmirched
by Peace, taxis remain trustworthy and
plentiful. The price marked on the
meter is that which the fare pays, and
any number of persons may ride in the
cab without extra charge. Nothing
exceeds my scorn for the English taxi-driver
who demands another ninepence
for an additional passenger, even though
only a child&mdash;nothing except my scorn
for the cowardly official who conceded
this monstrous imposition.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">To an Administrator.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I implore you to
authorise the instant removal of the
buildings in the St. James's Park lake?
During the War we who find on the
suspension bridge, looking West, the
most beautiful late afternoon view in
London, were content to endure the
invasion. But we have passed the
second Armistice Day, and still the
huts remain, and still there is no water,
and still the enchanted prospect is
denied us. After all, this lake is part
of London, and London ratepayers
should be entitled to their city's beauties
as well as its necessities.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">To a Pretty Girl.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear</span>,&mdash;I want you to be a little
more merciful. The other day, when
your father, over the eggs and bacon,
was reading out the news from Greece,
with the defeat of <span class="sc">Venizelos</span>, you said
lightly that exile didn't matter very
much because <span class="sc">Venizelos</span> was a very
old man. You then returned to the
absorbing occupation of identifying
Society people, reading from left to
right. Now <span class="sc">Venizelos</span> is fifty-five
years of age, and I cannot allow the
term "very old" to be applied to him
without protest; I am too nearly his
contemporary. "Getting on," if you
like, "mature," "ripe," but not "very
old." You must keep that phrase for
the people who&mdash;well, who <i>are</i> very old.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">To a Haberdasher.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When I came to put on
the collar that I bought from you yesterday
(I am the tallish customer who
takes sixteen and a half by two and was
in a hurry to get home to dress) I found
that your young man's finger-marks
were on it. Why don't you make your
assistants wear gloves when they handle
collars?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center"><span class="sc">To a Minister of Religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Your Far-from-serene Gloominess</span>,&mdash;Won't
you one day be a little cheerful,
and wrong? Won't you send out
a lifeboat to the wreck instead of watching
her through your smoked field-glasses
as she sinks? What you seem
to forget is that most people at times
are their own Gloomy Deans: some of us
too often; and there can be too much of
a good thing. Hopelessness butters no
parsnips and it is a mood not to be
encouraged or the world would be as
bad as we then think it. Gloomy-deaniness,
though salutary for brief intervals,
should be sparingly indulged
in; but you are at it all the time. There
is a Chinese proverb which says, "If
you can't smile don't open a shop;"
and, after all, St. Paul's Cathedral is in
a manner of speaking a kind of shop,
isn't it?&mdash;the goods, at any rate, should
be obtainable there. The phrase "there
is no health in us" does not constitute
the whole liturgy. Down with facile
optimists by all means, but, my dear
Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>MORE NOTES FROM A SYNTHETIC COUNTRY DIARY.</p>

<p><i>November 20th.</i>&mdash;I have been much struck this morning
by a remarkable instance of protective mimicry on the
part of a grey squirrel, which assumes attitudes and adopts
gestures which at a little distance render him almost indistinguishable
from a small monkey. <span class="sc">White's</span> <i>Selborne</i> throws
no light on this strange phenomenon, which I can only
explain as a result on the animal world of the now fashionable
<i>Tarzan</i> cult, which so happily reconciles the old hostility
between apes and angels.</p>

<p>Of the habits and customs of the hedgehog mention has
already been made in these notes. It may be added that
the whistle which these interesting creatures emit from time
to time resembles the <i>timbre</i> of a muted piccolo, and their
employment in a mixed orchestra is well worth the consideration
of our younger and more enterprising composers.
Another animal which shares with the hedgehog the defensive
faculty of rolling itself up in a ball is the "pill
millipede," a myriopod with seventeen pairs of legs, but
fortunately exempt from the necessity of wearing trousers,
which at present prices would impose an exorbitant demand
on its resources.</p>

<p>As winter draws on the evolutions of birds great and
small are a never-ending source of surprise and delight.
Many hooded crows are now to be seen consorting with the
rooks in the field and swelling the sable multitude that
flies at evensong towards the park trees. And great congregations
of plovers, curiously self-sufficing in their ability
to dispense with the services of any feathered parson, lend
colour and subconscious uplift to marshland scenes, which
would otherwise look extremely <i>triste</i>.</p>

<p>Small indigenous birds, such as titmice, chipmunks, pipits
and squinches, are constantly seen in coveys or even bevies
just now. A party of pipwinks visited my copse yesterday
afternoon, and indulged in delicious <i>morceaux</i> of melody
before the red sun sank starkly below the horizon....</p>

<p>As long as the weather remains open I find it a good
plan to plant flowers and shrubs which bloom in the spring.
Proticipation is a cardinal asset in the outfit of the judicious
gardener, and no time should be lost in completing the
spring beds, as the cost of hair-mattresses is going up by
leaps and bounds.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<span class="sc">Will You Kiss Me?</span>"</p>

<p>Even before the era of Prohibition
(there were cocktails in this play)
strange things must have happened in
"God's own country" under the banner
of the Bird of Freedom. But never so
strange as the effects you get on the
stage when very English people play
at being Americans. You have to be
rather young and unsophisticated if such
phrases as "He's putting it over on us,"
or "I'm not going to stand for that,"
generously peppered about the dialogue
and recited in the purest of English
accents, can persuade you to believe
that you are getting the real local
stuff. At the same time you accept
cheerfully the most farcical conditions
on the vague assumption
that all things may be possible
over there.</p>

<p>So, when <i>John W. Brook</i>, of Fifth
Avenue, millionaire, engaged the
services of <i>Alexander Y. Hedge</i>,
plenipotentiary representative of
an Efficiency Company, to introduce
economic reforms into his
motherless household during his
temporary absence, we regarded it
as a most reasonable experiment.
And for a time it made excellent
fun. But after a while it began to
wear thin for lack of fresh stimulus,
and by the end of the Second
Act there was a general feeling in
the audience that something would
have to be done about it.</p>

<p>The same thought seems to have
occurred to Mr. <span class="sc">Cyril Harcourt</span>,
the author, and he started, a little
late in the day, to introduce an
element of sex-romance into what
so far had been an absolutely
bloodless proposition. But at first
it was with sinister intent that
<i>Brook's</i> elder daughter made advances
to <i>Alexander Y. Hedge</i>. As soon as she
could induce this monster of inhumanity
to become a prey to her charm she
would repulse him with scorn, and
then he would have to go.</p>

<p>The children's allowances having been
cut off on the ground that they did
nothing to earn them, she offered her
services as his paid secretary. "Propinquity"
did its work and she was
soon in a position to offer him the
privilege of an experimental kiss, thus
incidentally justifying the dreadful title
of the play.</p>

<p>The first, delivered on the cheek, was
a wash-out; but the second, pressed
home on the lips, had the desired effect.
Then she turned and rent him, telling
him exactly what she thought of his
treatment of the family. He replied
with an eloquent philippic directed at
the vices of a bloated aristocracy (this
was the ante-bellum age, before things
had been made so much safer for democracy).
Almost before the applause of
the gallery had died down, the father
burst upon the scene, furious at the report
that this hired commercial had
been making love to his daughter.</p>

<h4>STEPS TOWARD EFFICIENCY.</h4>

<p><i>Horace, the Butler</i> (<span class="sc">Mr. C. V. France</span>) lengthens his
stride in obedience to</p>

<p><i>Alexander Y. Hedge</i> (<span class="sc">Mr. Donald Calthrop</span>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Explanations follow which appease
his wrath, and he is further mollified by
the statement that the Master of Efficiency
had cut down the expenses of
his <i>ménage</i> by some nineteen thousand
dollars. But why, when his feats of
economy had all the time been the
matter of his offence in the children's
eyes, the announcement of the total
should have favourably affected the
girl's heart I cannot say, and I don't
think anybody else can. Yet the fact
remains that the next moment she
undertakes to marry the object of her
previous loathing.</p>

<p>To have arrived naturally at such an
end would have meant a couple more
Acts, in which the man <i>Hedge</i> might
have had time to live down the evil
effects of his efficiency. But with so
much economy in the air the author
appears to have caught the infection
of it and economised in his processes
to save our time. That is the kindest
excuse I can find for him.</p>

<p>As for the moral, it would seem to
be that, if (as is more than probable)
you have no copy of the works of
<span class="sc">Aristotle</span> in your Fifth Avenue library,
and imagine, never having heard of the
happy mean, that virtue lies in one of
two excesses&mdash;an excess of idle luxury
or an excess of efficiency&mdash;the former
is the one to choose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Donald Calthrop</span> as <i>Hedge</i>
bore the burden of the play with a high
hand that had a very sure touch. It
was extraordinary with what alertness
and confidence he commanded every
situation&mdash;except, of course, the absurd
climax which nobody could hope to
handle. Mr. <span class="sc">C. V. France</span>, as the English
butler (ex-clergyman) who had
taken a long time to learn how to disfigure
his aspirates (out of deference to
the American legend), gave a very fresh
and attractive performance. Some of
the best things in the dialogue&mdash;not
always very humorous&mdash;were given
to little <i>Alice Brook</i> (aged 14), one
of those precocities for which
America has always held the
world's record. I don't know, and
should not think of asking, Miss
<span class="sc">Ann Trevor's</span> age, but she looked
to me a little old for the part of
this child, however precocious.
Miss <span class="sc">Marjorie Gordon</span> played
with intelligence as the elder sister,
but never for a moment suggested
a New York atmosphere. Indeed
she adopted just the mincing kind
of speech which out there is held
to bewray the "Britisher." The
only performance that made any
real pretence of being American was
that of Mr. <span class="sc">Turnbull</span> as the manager
of the Efficiency Company.</p>

<p>Still, after all, local colour is no
great matter so long as you get
some recognisable aspect, though
farcically presented, of human nature;
but the trouble with this
play is that while our sense of the
probabilities is never too much
outraged so long as the chief character
is just a piece of inhuman
machinery, the author lapses into
the incredible the moment he tries to
introduce a little humanity into his
scheme. However, I have perhaps
taken things too seriously, instead of
being properly grateful for some very
good entertainment.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Inevitably one's first thought on sighting <i>A Naval
History of the War</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) is that he
must be a brave skipper indeed who would take out a lone
ship, however excellently found, to cruise such controversial
waters. But Sir <span class="sc">Henry Newbolt</span> is an experienced hand,
and, though (so to speak) one finds him at times conscious
of Sir <span class="sc">Julian Corbett</span> on the sky-line, he brings off his
self-appointed task triumphantly. To drop metaphor, here
is a temperate and clearly-written history, midway between
the technical and the popular, of a kind precisely
suited to the plain man who wishes a comprehensive <i>résumé</i>
of the course of the War at sea. For this purpose its
arrangement is admirable, the story being presented first
in a general survey under dates, then in special chapters
devoted to episodes or aspects, <i>e.g.</i>, Coronel and the Falklands
(that unmatchable drama of disaster and revenge),
the submarines and their countering, and finally Jutland.
Throughout, as I have said, Sir <span class="sc">Henry</span>, having one of the
best stories in the world to tell, is at pains to avoid anything
that even remotely approaches fine writing. Only
once have I even detected the literary man, when, in describing
the strange finish of the <i>Königsberg</i>, he permits himself
the pleasure of calling it "the sea fight in the forest." For
the rest, the "strength and splendour" of England's greatest
naval war are left to make their own impression. I shall
be astonished if such a book, having figured brilliantly as a
present this Christmas, is not treasured for generations as
a work of family reference in hundreds of British homes.</p>

<p>The name of Mrs. <span class="sc">Belloc Lowndes</span> on the outside would
alone have made me open <i>From the Vasty Deep</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>)
with a pleasant anticipation of creepiness, even
without the generous measure of bogies depicted on the
coloured wrapper. Having now read the story, I am bound
to add (and I can only hope that Mrs. <span class="sc">Lowndes</span> will take
my admission for the compliment that it really is) that the
net result has been one of slight disappointment. Briefly,
I continue to prefer the writer as a criminal, rather than a
psychic, "Fat Boy." After all, once grant your ghost and
anyone can conjure it, with appropriate circumstance, at
the proper moments. Wyndfell Hall was full enough of
ghosts, all ready to appear at the voluntary or involuntary
instance of a young lady named <i>Bubbles</i>, who was one of
the Christmas house-party and the owner of a rather uncomfortable
gift of spook-raising. But beyond making
themselves an occasional nuisance to the guests I couldn't
find that the phantoms did anything practical to help along
such plot as there was. Even the quite palpable fact that
the host was at least a double murderer came to proof by
the ordinary process of law rather than by any supernatural
revelation. Before this I have gratefully owed to Mrs.
<span class="sc">Lowndes</span> the raising of my remaining hairs like quills upon
the fretful porcupine, but the ca'-canny bogies of her present
story are too perfunctory to excuse even a shiver in any but
the most unsophisticated reader.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It may, I suppose, be accounted for righteousness to
Major-General Sir <span class="sc">Archibald Anson</span> that in <i>About Others
and Myself</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>) he is so little of an egotist as to
convey scarcely any impression of what manner of man he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>
is or what he thinks of this or that. Much more clear
from her quoted letters is the character of his grandmother,
who vainly tried to keep the over-gallant First Gentleman
of Europe out of mischief. Our autobiographer gives us a
plain, blunt, not to say bald record of what must have been
an interesting life. He was at Eton under <span class="sc">Keate</span>; a
cadet at Woolwich, where he saw a gunner receive two
hundred lashes; a gunnery subaltern in the Crimea, where
he saw many queer and unedifying things; a successful
administrator in Madagascar, Mauritius and Penang, and
finally Governor of the Straits Settlements, with a K.C.M.G.
and honourable retirement to follow. But he is a man of
action rather than words, and his faculty of observation is
but too often exercised upon such slender matters as that
"Poor Captain Powlett met with a misfortune on the way
to Kedah. His servant laid the
dinner things on the deck of the
gunboat, then went below for
something and, coming up again,
accidentally walked into the middle
of the crockery and glass,
causing considerable destruction."
Also, I think he quotes
his testimonials&mdash;those never
very candid and always very dull
documents&mdash;much too freely.
The best of the book is concerned
with his administration
work in Penang and district,
where on the evidence he seems
to have kept his end up with
skill and no small zeal for good
government.</p>

<p>The title of Lady (<span class="sc">Laura</span>)
<span class="sc">Troubridge's</span> new novel, <i>O Perfect
Love</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), applies to
her V. C. hero only; with his
wife it is a case of O Very Imperfect
Love. <i>Jean Chartres</i> is a
common product of the age, the
sort of girl that insists on "having
a good time" and "living her
life" and "being herself" (how
well one knows the jargon!).
Less common, let us hope, is
the woman who would desert
her husband, as <i>Jean</i> did, because
the injuries he had received
in the War prevented him from giving her the kind of
life for which she craved. Foolish rather than vicious, she
drifts into a relationship which could have had only one
conclusion, if her lover, tiring of platonics, had not prematurely
pressed his demands. Thoroughly scared by his
violence she runs away and finds sanctuary with the "perfect
love" of the title. In this happy solution she had
better fortune than she deserved. It is not every woman
who has the good luck, when rushing blindly out of the
House of Peril into the wintry night (in a ball-dress), to
find&mdash;what had apparently escaped <i>Jean's</i> memory for the
moment&mdash;that her faithful husband's estate is in the immediate
neighbourhood. Though Lady <span class="sc">Troubridge's</span> sense of
style is not impeccable she can tell a good tale; her dialogue
rings true and her characters are well observed. The
trouble with most authors of Society novels is that either
they know their subject but can't write, or that they can
write but know nothing of their subject. Lady <span class="sc">Troubridge</span>
is one of the very few writers in this kind who both know
their world and how to portray it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">B. Bennion</span> follows the vogue for confidentially descriptive
covers in announcing, as a title to his volume of
angling reminiscences, that <i>The Trout are Rising in England
and South Africa</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) and suggesting that here is "a book
for slippered ease." One is certainly warned not to expect
anything very strenuous in its course, and indeed so placidly
flow its waters that few, perhaps, but devotees of the craft
will follow it to the end. Not but what there are metaphorical
trout in it, too&mdash;enticing descriptions of bits of
rivers, for instance&mdash;but on the whole they are easy-going
fish that come to bank without showing very much
sporting spirit. Here is no manual of precise information,
though even old fishermen may gather a hint or two; nor
yet a guide-book to the trout-streams of two continents;
not even a collection of good stories, though anyone may
come across some old friends in
it. The author's yarns indeed
are numerous and, on the whole,
as an angler's yarns should be,
picturesque. If he does seem to
enjoy the rather feeble joke or
incident as much as the other
sort, that may be natural in a
book of ease, whether slippered
or not. Indeed one half suspects
it is as a book for his own
ease that the writer is mainly
considering it, yet, taken in the
right spirit and especially if you
are an enticer of trout, it may
be for your ease too. Of course,
if you are not an angler and if
your spirit is not right, the
slipper may not fit.</p>

<p>In the course of a long study
of detective fiction I have never
met any sleuths with a gift of
loquacity like that of <i>Messrs.
Corson</i> and <i>Gibbs</i>, who during
the first part of <i>In the Onyx
Lobby</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>)
make futile efforts to trace the
murderer of <i>Sir Herbert Binney</i>,
proprietor of Binney's Buns.
<i>Sir Herbert</i> had gone to New
York to persuade his nephew
to become the manager of an
American branch of a Binney
Bun factory, and, on returning late at night to his apartment-house,
was stabbed to death. Fortunately Miss
<span class="sc">Carolyn Wells</span> seems to have grown as tired of them as
I did, and they give way to one <i>Pennington Wise</i> (whose
name did not prepossess me in his favour) and his assistant,
<i>Zizi</i>. This couple have the authentic sleuth-touch, and
their detection of those implicated in the murder is a very
ingenious piece of work. There is so much padding in this
book that if <i>Sir Herbert</i> had worn a tithe of it no stabber
could even have scratched him; but with judicious skipping
it will wile away two or three idle hours. And, as I
said, the solution is a really skilful piece of work.</p>
